# Linear Perceptron Portfolio
Personal project to understand the algorithm at its most basic level (numpy only). Takes inputs and target values from csv and calculates weights by feeding neuron output directly into MAX loss function. The loss function is then minimised using stochastic gradient descent Decision boundary is then plotted and distance to inputs is calculated.
